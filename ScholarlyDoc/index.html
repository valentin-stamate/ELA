    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In regards to programming languages, esoteric languages represent unique challenges and opportunities for
        enthusiasts, researchers, and learners alike. This scholarly documentation introduces a conceptual model
        and a web-based platform designed to facilitate exploration, learning of esoteric programming languages.
        Leveraging existing lists of esoteric languages and enriched with knowledge from
        <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and
        <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>, our system offers a
        thesaurus-like
        ontology that categorizes languages based on paradigms, usability, computational class, and other distinguishing
        features.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed platform serves as a service-oriented architecture, delivering diverse functionalities to users. It
        enables the best possible language selection for learning, programming, translation into general-purpose
        languages. By exposing a SPARQL endpoint, the system provides a wealth of information about related tools,
        including interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the platform's most notable features is its ability to recommend esoteric programming languages based on
        a quiz to find the most relevant features of an esoteric language for end users . This recommendation engine
        enhances the user experience, guiding individuals toward languages that align with their specific interests and
        objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the subsequent sections, this documentation presents the systematic construction of our conceptual model,
        detailing the amalgamation of esoteric language data from diverse sources and the development of an intuitive
        web interface.

    <h2>Structure of the web application</h2>
    <section id="general">
        <h3>General</h3>

        <p>
            For tracking the history of the application we will use
            <a href="https://github.com/valentin-stamate/ELA" target="_blank">Github</a> because it's a very
            popular platform for version control. We can even make use of some new feature of this platform such as
            Github Actions witch is a CI/CD tool very powerful: the artifacts can be stored inside the repository as
            well as env variables and is integrated with many types of applications: nodejs, java, php, ruby etc.

        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
            <img src="./img/screen_01.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="img">

        <p>
            Here we can see the mockup of the UI interface we want to implement. The first image is the initial page the
            user sees. After the start button is pressed then in the second screen the user will be guided to some
            questions
            to answer in order to make the recommendation better. After the questions are finished it will be displayed
            a
            tables with some information regarding the recommended programming languages that are best suited for
            learning.
            For more information, once a row is clicked the last page will appear with more information.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <section id="overview">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The success of our esoteric programming language exploration platform hinges on a well-structured system
            architecture. This chapter provides a glimpse into the architecture, highlighting the key components that
            drive the platform's functionality. The general structure comprises a frontend, a backend, and an RDF
            store for SPARQL queries, integrated together to offer a cohesive user experience.

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>

        <p>
            Represents the component the user interacts with that will be written in Angular witch is
            a widely-used open-source web application framework maintained by Google
            and a community of developers. It's written in TypeScript and facilitates the
            development of dynamic, single-page web applications. Angular provides a
            comprehensive set of tools and features that simplify various aspects of web development,
            including data binding, dependency injection, modularization, and testing. This makes the
            development easier as every component is treated as a class together with a template and
            a stylesheet and enforces an organized file structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The advantage of using typescript, the language used also for the backend, is using strong data types when
            needed
            that makes the code easier to debug and maintain.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ui-mockup">
        <h3>Backend</h3>

        <p>
            It is the server that handles the user requests. Build with Express it follows the REST architecture
            enforcing us
            to create endpoints associated with certain resources. The information between the client and the server
            will be in JSON
            format because is easy to work with and is translated directly as javascript object. Express is also a very
            popular lightweight
            framework that has many libraries that we can use to make our work easier.
        </p>

    <section id="rdf-store">
        <h3>RDF Store</h3>
        <p>
            In the architecture of our esoteric programming language exploration platform, the RDF store plays a key
            role in housing the ontology created with the available data
            (<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank">List of esoteric programming
            languages</a>). We have chosen Apache Jena Fuseki as our RDF store, a robust and scalable solution that
            seamlessly integrates with the broader semantic web infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/" target="_blank">Apache Jena Fuseki</a> serves as
            our chosen RDF store due to its efficiency in managing and querying RDF data. It provides a robust and
            scalable platform for storing ontological information about esoteric programming languages. The RDF store is
            a critical component, housing the structured knowledge derived from existing lists of languages and enriched
            through integration with <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and
            <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sparql">
        <h3>SPARQL Endpoint</h3>
        <p>
            One crucial component that lets users engage with the RDF store and query and retrieve specific data on
            esoteric programming languages is the SPARQL endpoint. By offering a user-specific way to explore the rich
            dataset from the RDF store, it improves the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Functionality:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                <b>Querying:</b> To obtain comprehensive details about esoteric languages, such as their paradigms,
                computational classes, and other characteristics, users can create SPARQL queries.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flexibility:</b> Because of SPARQL's flexibility, users can create their queries to meet their own
                requirements, from straightforward questions to intricate ontology studies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Integration:</b> The web-based platform and the SPARQL endpoint are smoothly integrated, enabling
                users to move from browsing language recommendations to querying precise details about the languages
                they have selected.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="docker">
        <h3>Docker</h3>

        <p>
            Each component will run a docker container in the final stage of the application. This provides several
            advantages
            such as isolation, portability, dependency management, scalability, security and we can deploy the
            components easier in a
            cloud provider.
