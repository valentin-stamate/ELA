    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In regards to programming languages, esoteric languages represent unique challenges and opportunities for
        enthusiasts, researchers, and learners alike. This scholarly documentation introduces a conceptual model
        and a web-based platform designed to facilitate exploration, learning of esoteric programming languages.
        Leveraging existing lists of esoteric languages and enriched with knowledge from
        <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and
        <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>, our system offers a
        thesaurus-like
        ontology that categorizes languages based on paradigms, usability, computational class, and other distinguishing
        features.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed platform serves as a service-oriented architecture, delivering diverse functionalities to users. It
        enables the best possible language selection for learning, programming, translation into general-purpose
        languages. By exposing a SPARQL endpoint, the system provides a wealth of information about related tools,
        including interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the platform's most notable features is its ability to recommend esoteric programming languages based on
        a quiz to find the most relevant features of an esoteric language for end users . This recommendation engine
        enhances the user experience, guiding individuals toward languages that align with their specific interests and
        objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the subsequent sections, this documentation presents the systematic construction of our conceptual model,
        detailing the amalgamation of esoteric language data from diverse sources and the development of an intuitive
        web interface.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>


    <section id="rdf-store">
        <h3>RDF Store</h3>
        <p>
            In the architecture of our esoteric programming language exploration platform, the RDF store plays a key
            role in housing the ontology created with the available data
            (<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank">List of esoteric programming
            languages</a>). We have chosen Apache Jena Fuseki as our RDF store, a robust and scalable solution that
            seamlessly integrates with the broader semantic web infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/" target="_blank">Apache Jena Fuseki</a> serves as
            our chosen RDF store due to its efficiency in managing and querying RDF data. It provides a robust and
            scalable platform for storing ontological information about esoteric programming languages. The RDF store is
            a critical component, housing the structured knowledge derived from existing lists of languages and enriched
            through integration with <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and
            <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>.

    <section id="sparql">
        <h3>SPARQL Endpoint</h3>
        <p>
            One crucial component that lets users engage with the RDF store and query and retrieve specific data on
            esoteric programming languages is the SPARQL endpoint. By offering a user-specific way to explore the rich
            dataset from the RDF store, it improves the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Functionality:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                <b>Querying:</b> To obtain comprehensive details about esoteric languages, such as their paradigms,
                computational classes, and other characteristics, users can create SPARQL queries.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flexibility:</b> Because of SPARQL's flexibility, users can create their queries to meet their own
                requirements, from straightforward questions to intricate ontology studies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Integration:</b> The web-based platform and the SPARQL endpoint are smoothly integrated, enabling
                users to move from browsing language recommendations to querying precise details about the languages
                they have selected.
