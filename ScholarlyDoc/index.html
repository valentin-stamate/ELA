    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In regards to programming languages, esoteric languages represent unique challenges and opportunities for
        enthusiasts, researchers, and learners alike. This scholarly documentation introduces a conceptual model
        and a web-based platform designed to facilitate exploration, learning of esoteric programming languages.
        Leveraging existing lists of esoteric languages and enriched with knowledge from
        <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and
        <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>, our system offers a
        thesaurus-like
        ontology that categorizes languages based on paradigms, usability, computational class, and other distinguishing
        features.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed platform serves as a service-oriented architecture, delivering diverse functionalities to users. It
        enables the best possible language selection for learning, programming, translation into general-purpose
        languages. By exposing a SPARQL endpoint, the system provides a wealth of information about related tools,
        including interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the platform's most notable features is its ability to recommend esoteric programming languages based on
        a quiz to find the most relevant features of an esoteric language for end users . This recommendation engine
        enhances the user experience, guiding individuals toward languages that align with their specific interests and
        objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the subsequent sections, this documentation presents the systematic construction of our conceptual model,
        detailing the amalgamation of esoteric language data from diverse sources and the development of an intuitive
        web interface.

    <h2>Structure of the web application</h2>

    <section id="github">
        <h3>Github</h3>

        <p>
            For tracking the history of the application we will use
            <a href="https://github.com/valentin-stamate/ELA" target="_blank">Github</a> because it's a very
            popular platform for version control. We can even make use of some new feature of this platform such as
            Github Actions witch is a CI/CD tool very powerful: the artifacts can be stored inside the repository as
            well as env variables and is integrated with many types of applications: nodejs, java, php, ruby etc.

            Here we can see the mockup of the UI interface we want to implement. The first image is the initial page the
            user sees. After the start button is pressed then in the second screen the user will be guided to some
            questions
            to answer in order to make the recommendation better. After the questions are finished it will be displayed
            a
            tables with some information regarding the recommended programming languages that are best suited for
            learning.
            For more information, once a row is clicked the last page will appear with more information.

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <section id="overview">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The success of our esoteric programming language exploration platform hinges on a well-structured system
            architecture. This chapter provides a glimpse into the architecture, highlighting the key components that
            drive the platform's functionality. The general structure comprises a frontend, a backend, and an RDF
            store for SPARQL queries, integrated together to offer a cohesive user experience.
        </p>

    <section id="components-architecture">
        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>

        <p>
            Represents the component the user interacts with that will be written in Angular witch is
            a widely-used open-source web application framework maintained by Google
            and a community of developers. It's written in TypeScript and facilitates the
            development of dynamic, single-page web applications. Angular provides a
            comprehensive set of tools and features that simplify various aspects of web development,
            including data binding, dependency injection, modularization, and testing. This makes the
            development easier as every component is treated as a class together with a template and
            a stylesheet and enforces an organized file structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The advantage of using typescript, the language used also for the backend, is using strong data types when
            needed
            that makes the code easier to debug and maintain.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ui-mockup">
        <h3>Backend</h3>

        <p>
            Initially we have thought about using typescript together with express framework to create the backend of
            the application but, while design the system we opted for an approach using python since in can handle
            better the data that needs to be inserted and retrieved from the RDF Store.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, we have implemented a Django server exposing an API for data management in the frontend.
            The API documentation can be found
            <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/valentin.stamate/ela/1.0.0">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this API we are exposing methods for querying the ontology in the RDF Store and formatting the data in a
            friendly way for the users. We opted to do the text processing in the backend to reduce as much as possible
            the load in the UI, to improve user experience.
        </p>
    </section>


    <section id="rdf-store">
        <h3>RDF Store</h3>
        <p>
            In the architecture of our esoteric programming language exploration platform, the RDF store plays a key
            role in housing the ontology created with the available data
            (<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank">List of esoteric programming
            languages</a>). We have chosen Apache Jena Fuseki as our RDF store, a robust and scalable solution that
            seamlessly integrates with the broader semantic web infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/" target="_blank">Apache Jena Fuseki</a> serves as
            our chosen RDF store due to its efficiency in managing and querying RDF data. It provides a robust and
            scalable platform for storing ontological information about esoteric programming languages. The RDF store is
            a critical component, housing the structured knowledge derived from existing lists of languages and enriched
            through integration with <a role="doc-biblioref" href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/"
                                        target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and
            <a role="doc-biblioref" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>.
        </p>


    </section>

    <section id="sparql">
        <h3>SPARQL Endpoint</h3>
        <p>
            One crucial component that lets users engage with the RDF store and query and retrieve specific data on
            esoteric programming languages is the SPARQL endpoint. By offering a user-specific way to explore the rich
            dataset from the RDF store, it improves the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Functionality:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                <b>Querying:</b> To obtain comprehensive details about esoteric languages, such as their paradigms,
                computational classes, and other characteristics, users can create SPARQL queries.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flexibility:</b> Because of SPARQL's flexibility, users can create their queries to meet their own
                requirements, from straightforward questions to intricate ontology studies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Integration:</b> The web-based platform and the SPARQL endpoint are smoothly integrated, enabling
                users to move from browsing language recommendations to querying precise details about the languages
                they have selected.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To be able to use a RDF Store to host an ontology we firstly had to create one. For this task we have chose
            to model the ontology using <a href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">PROTÉGÉ</a>. Using the tool the design
            of the ontology was easier to do. Since our project is focused esoteric programming language we thought this
            should be the "main" entity in our ontology (the use of the quotes is because, theoretically speaking there
            is no such thing as a main entity in an ontology). The reason why we call this the main entity is to explain
            why most of the properties are linked to it and the other entities are simpler. We chose to not over
            complicate the other entities and keep focus only on what we were interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
            To have a better view on our ontology, we have used a plugin for <a role="doc-biblioref"
                                                                                href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">PROTÉGÉ</a>
            named <a role="doc-biblioref" href="https://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/VOWL">VOWL</a>. Using this we were
            able to have a
            graphical view of the ontology (that can be seen in the following picture)
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="./img/ontology.png" style="width:100%" alt="img">
        </div>
        <p>
            Even though all of our entities have the rdfs:label property using this plugin will not display it this way.
            Using the same ontology exported from PROTÉGÉ, and instead of the plugin, using it's online counterpart
            <a href="https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/">WebVOWL</a> we have a better representation of our ontology.
        </p>

            <img src="./img/ontology2.png" style="width:100%" alt="img">
        </div>
        <p>
            Because it may be unclear from the pictures what are all the properties available in the ontology, here is a

        <h3>Finding Data about Esolangs</h3>
        To populate the ontology with data about esolangsm we have used multiple approaches:
        <ul>
            <li>
                At first, we have used a python script to extract all esolangs names available in the <a
                    role="doc-biblioref"
                    href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list">esolang list</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the extracted names we have than tried to get all the data that as possible from better sources
                like <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                On <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> we didn't find much
                data about esolangs. The initial extracted list have around 3000 names of
                esolangs, and from <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a> we
                were able to extract 20 esolangs which was not enough for our application
            </li>
            <li>
                From <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a> we were
                luckier, and we were able to extract data about 48 esolangs
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the two datasets were not mutually exclusive, we were left in the end with 55 esolangs and data
                about them.
                But not all the above-mentioned esolangs had all properties mentioned before.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All the data that was extracted from <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/sparql/" target="_blank">DBpedia</a>
            or <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a>, was through
            sparql after scanning the available documentations to find the best parameter for the queries.
            The queries were run on each dataset for all the ~3000 esolang labels mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
            This query was used for Dbpedia:

        After retrieving the data we had to populate it into our ontology. For this had already hosted the ontology
        export from the Protégé tool in the RDF store provided by Apache Jena Fuseki. For this, were also used sparql
        queries to insert esolangs and other entities (country, computer language). Here is a code snippet of the query
        used for an esolang (Keep in mind that this is only an example since not all properties are available for all
        esolangs):

    <p>
        Before inserting an esolang we made sure to insert the other related entities to be able to make correct
        associations between them. The queries for those entities look similar but simpler. Also, to avoid double
        insertion of esolangs or other entities we have used a sparql query with <i>ASK WHERE</i> to check whether the
        same esolang label already exists in the RDF Store.
    </p>
    <p>
        A similar query, but slightly modified is used for inserting new esolang from user input. As it is impossible to
        make an automation to retrieve data from the esolang list since it not structured in any way, out best hope to
        improve the quantity and quality of the stored in the RDF Store is have user help. As is it was mentioned
        before, there a page in the application the provides support to add new languages. So any user the is willing to
        support this initiative can fill the form with information about esolangs and the data will be added in the RDF
        Store
