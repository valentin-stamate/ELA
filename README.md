<p>
    Using the existing list of esoteric programming languages in conjunction with additional knowledge provided by DBpedia and/or Wikidata, create a proper conceptual model (thesaurus, ontology).
    Develop a (micro- service Web-based platform proving various ways to choose an esoteric language for learning, programming, translating into a general purpose language, research,... 
    By exposing a SPARQL endpoint, the system will also provide information of interest about related tools like interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and others. 
    Additionally, it could recommend other (esoteric) programming languages according to user preferences, language categories (paradigm, usability, computational class, other features), pragmatic usages, etc.
